					<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>Since the 90s, data architecture teams have distinguished between operational and analytical workloads with the terms online transactional processing (OLTP) and online analytical processing (OLAP). While the data and technologies we use for applications has evolved over the years, these terms are still very relevant today.</p>

<p>OLTP workloads tend to be dominated by discrete operations that read, write, update, or delete a small number of records for each transaction. These applications tend to support many concurrent operations (thousands of queries per second), with low latency (&lt;10ms) and high availability (99.999% uptime). When these systems are down or slow, they can significantly impact the business. A good example is an ecommerce system for a popular retail site.</p>

<p>In contrast, OLAP workloads are dominated by queries that read large numbers of records for each operation. These queries usually involve aggregations - SUM, MIN, MAX, AVG, etc. - across several dimensions of the data. OLAP queries tend to touch orders of magnitude more data than OLTP queries as they span most or all of the records for each operation. There tend to be fewer concurrent users, and the latency requirements tend to be more relaxed when compared to OLTP systems.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-olap-on-hadoop">What is OLAP on Hadoop?</h3>

<p>Many companies have embraced a Data Lake strategy for modern data analytics. In this model data from operational systems is moved to Hadoop for long term storage, processing, and analytics. Hadoop’s rich ecosystem of tools and integrations addresses a wide range of workloads through a shared resource model. Furthermore, Hadoop’s architecture and scalability allow companies to secure and centrally manage storage and compute resources of virtually any scale.</p>

<p>OLAP on Hadoop is a category of products that leverage Hadoop to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stage raw data that has been moved to HDFS by a user-managed, external process</li>
  <li>Build and store data cubes that contain pre-computed measures across many dimensions of data   to improve the speed of analytical queries</li>
  <li>Execute queries using a distributed SQL engine running in the Hadoop cluster</li>
  <li>Provide proprietary BI features as part of their product, or ODBC drivers for third party BI tools.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-is-dremio">What is Dremio?</h3>

<p>Dremio is a new and unique approach to data analytics that let’s you do more with your data, with less effort, and at an end-to-end speed never before possible. Unlike OLAP on Hadoop products, Dremio is a comprehensive solution that eliminates the need for complex ETL, aggregation tables, or data cubes. Instead of cobbling together products from multiple vendors, Dremio lets you start seeing value in minutes, with a user experience whose quality is unprecedented in the Hadoop market.</p>

<p>Dremio seamlessly accelerates all of your data, not just the things you’ve moved to HDFS, with optimized push downs to relational and nonrelational systems like MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and S3. Dremio lets you reach your data faster, with far less effort.</p>

<p>Analysts connect to Dremio with their favorite BI tool (Tableau, Power BI, Qlik Sense, etc.) or language (SQL, R, Python, etc.). To an analyst, all data appears as tables, no matter what system it came from, with the full power of SQL to join, aggregate, transform and sort data across one or more data sources. And entirely transparent to your users, Dremio’s autonomous cache accelerates your data so that no matter how big it is or where it came from, it feels small, approachable, and instantaneous. Unlike cubes that only work for a small set of pre-defined queries, Dremio makes all your SQL fast, including ad-hoc row-level queries.</p>

<p>Dremio runs as a distributed process in your Hadoop cluster, provisioned and managed by YARN. With Dremio you can query data that’s already in HDFS, or you can query external systems directly, removing the need for ETL.</p>

<p class="blue">Unlike OLAP on Hadoop, Dremio allows you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Run SQL on any data source.</em> Including optimized push downs and parallel connectivity to non-relational systems like MongoDB, Elasticsearch, S3 and HDFS.</li>
  <li><em>Autonomously caches your data.</em> Using columnar, compressed Apache Arrow for efficient in-memory analytical processing, and Apache Parquet for persistence.</li>
  <li><em>Accelerates all your BI queries.</em> Ad-hoc queries on row-level data as well as aggregation queries.</li>
  <li><em>Integrated data curation.</em> Easy for business users, yet sufficiently powerful for your data engineers, and fully integrated into Dremio.</li>
  <li><em>The Data Graph.</em> Full visibility into your data lineage, from your data sources, through transformations, joining with other data sources, and sharing with other users.</li>
</ul>
